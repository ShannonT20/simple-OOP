# Explanation of Ecocash Python Code

## Introduction
The provided Python code represents a simple program for an Ecocash system. Ecocash is a mobile money transfer service, and the code simulates a basic login system with limited attempts.

## Class: Ecocash

### Constructor `__init__(self, pin, trial, reEnter)`
- Initializes the Ecocash class with three attributes: `pin` (PIN for login), `trial` (number of login attempts allowed), and `reEnter` (variable for re-entering the PIN).

### Method: `econetcode(self, code)`
- Simulates entering an Ecocash code. It prompts the user to input a code, and if the entered code is "*151#", it proceeds; otherwise, the program exits.

### Method: `login(self)`
- Implements the login functionality. It prompts the user to enter a PIN and allows a limited number of login attempts.
- If the correct PIN (1234) is entered, the program prints "Login successful!" and proceeds.
- If an incorrect PIN is entered, the user is prompted to re-enter the PIN. After three unsuccessful attempts, the account is blocked.

### Method: `login_successful(self)`
- Prints a menu with options when the login is successful. These options include sending money, receiving money, updating Ecocash PIN, and balance enquiry.
- The output of this method is written to a Markdown file named "output.md".

## Execution
1. An instance of the Ecocash class is created with initial values for `pin`, `trial`, and `reEnter`.
2. The `econetcode` method simulates entering an Ecocash code.
3. The `login` method simulates the login process, checking the entered PIN and handling login attempts.
4. If the login is successful, the `login_successful` method prints a menu and writes it to the "output.md" file.

## Output
The final output is a Markdown file ("output.md") that contains a menu with options for a successful Ecocash login.
